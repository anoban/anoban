## ***Hi there!*** ðŸ‘‹
- I'm quite proficient in R, Python and Microsoft Excel in data analaytics use cases.      
- I have certifications in web development, both fronend (HTML5, CSS & Javascript) and backend (Node, Python) but I tend to think that web development is just not my cup of tea.         
- I'm really interested in low-level programming using C & assembly.          
- I'm a Botanist by degree (lmao) but love learning new things in free time!.         
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Powershell, x64 assembly (MASM), C and GO. (I know these to some extent, but still not confident enough to say that I know them lol)            
- Wanted to learn Rust, but gave up because it's too big for my taste.        
- I prefer languages that are efficient and concise.           
- I have a strong impulse to do things in ways others would consider reckless or unconventional, both in programming and real life lmao.              
- My programming journey started with R so I'm more inclined towards functional/procedural programming with a strong dislike for OOP.                   
- And I love analyzing massive datasets, finding patterns and making visualizations because it's cool to extract knowledge from a bunch of characters and numbers.            
- I kinda hate ML and ML realted things.                
- âš¡ ***Every transistor matters and each bit counts!***  

If you really made it to the end, gee thanks for the interest lol!
