# ***Hi there!*** ðŸ‘‹
- Quite proficient in R, Python and Microsoft Excel in data analaytics use cases.      
- I have certifications in web development, both fronend (HTML5, CSS & Javascript) and backend (Node, Python) but I tend to think that web development is just not my cup of tea.         
- Really interested in low-level programming using C & assembly.             
- Currently learning Powershell, x64 assembly (MASM), C and GO. (I know these to some extent, but still not confident enough to say that I know them lol)            
- My programming journey started with R so I'm more inclined towards functional/procedural programming with a strong dislike for OOP.
